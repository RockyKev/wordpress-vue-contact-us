## Introduction

## What we are doing:

We are creating a contact us form using vue. 

The Contact Us form has a few different input field types. It's also broken into components for usability. 
* Text field
* TextArea field
* Radio Button
* Checkbox

props include: 
* Placeholder 
* Label
* Required

The components also emit data back up to the parent component.

## Prerequsites:

1. SIgn up with SendGrid, so you can use their API. Sendgrid has a free version, and a much more reliable chance of emails getting into your inbox. 

## Process:

TODO: explain the steps

## STEP BY STEP:

### STEP 1: Use my vue scaffolding. 
More information. 
How it works.

### STEP 2: Let's build out 4 components.
[Tree]

Text FIeld Compeonent

```vue
// inside app/src/components/input-text.vue
```

TextArea Input Compeonent
```vue
// inside app/src/components/input-textarea.vue
```

Checkbox Input Component
```vue
// inside app/src/components/input-checkbox.vue
```

Radio Input Component
```vue
// inside app/src/components/input-radio.vue
```

### STEP 3: Building the Vue form

The primary form:
```vue

```

Notice tha ajax post call. 
It's going to send the form data to a php file. 

### STEP 4: Creating that PHP file.

Wordpress by default uses phpmailer();

So we can tap into that baby!

### Step 5: building a quick settings page to save your Credentials
